        <h3 class="card-title">Course Description</h3>

        <p class="card-text">
            In CSE115 you've learned the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, file IO, networking, databases, and security. With these concepts you can train a computer
            to complete any task you can imagine. So what's left to study in CSE116?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How do we write large programs?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            While it's true that you can do anything already, it becomes very difficult very fast to organize and write
            a large and complex piece of software. You will practice this in CSE116 by studying topics such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Testing</b> to be confident that you program works before submitting to AutoLab</li>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> to organize and reuse code</li>
            <li><b>Functional Programming</b> which simplifies certain problems</li>
            <li>Several <b>Data Structures</b> to organize and efficiently access data</li>
            <li>And finally <b>Concurrency</b> allowing multiple pieces of code to execute at the same time while
                communicating with each other
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a strong focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just that
            they work.
        </p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Want to learn computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Already be comfortable with all of the CSE115 material</li>
            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (Except the first week when there are no labs)</li>
            <li>Bring a working and charged laptop to lecture (If this is an issue please contact Jesse immediately)</li>
            <li>Spend at least 7 hours each week outside of class/lab for a total of at least 12 hours/week on CSE116
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you are not comfortable with all the CSE115 material you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week until you are caught up with the material.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are unable or unwilling to spend at least 12 hours/week on this course, please navigate your

        <p>
            Your final grade will be determined using a points based system with the following max points per category:
        </p>

        <table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">

        <p>
            In accordance with the university grading policy, if you earn an F in this course while attending
            less than 60% of the meetings time (lecture and lab) you will instead earn a grade of FX.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Homework</h4>

        <p>
            There are 10 assigned homework assignments throughout the semester worth 50 points each. These are to be
            completed outside of class/lab and will consume the majority of your >=7 hours/week outside of class.
            To meet the objectives of this course these assignments will all require you to write fairly large programs
            with little guidance. In addition, you will not receive feedback on your submissions other than your score
            and compatibility issues (The grader will let you know if you, for example, have the wrong filenames
            or directory structure). To encourage proper testing, you must test your own code and submit those tests
            in order to receive full credit on any homework assignment.
        </p>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Lab Quizzes and Final Exam</h4>

        <p>
            There are 6 total sections of the course that will be tested via written quizzes and an exam. Each section
            is worth 100 points. The first 5 sections will be tested through 1 hour written lab quizzes and the final
            exam will test all 6 sections separately. Your grade for each section will be the max of your lab quiz score
            and you score for that section on the final exam (except section 6 which is only on the final exam). If you
            do well on all the lab quizzes you may have a low-stress, or even skip, the final exam. However, if you do
            poorly on some, or all, of the lab quizzes you can still recover those points by proving that you understand
            the material at the end of the semester on the final exam. You cannot makeup the lab quizzes for any reason,
            but you can use the final exam to makeup for any quiz even if you didn't take the quiz.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Lab Activities</h4>

        <p>
            There will be 5 lab activities covering a variety of topics. Lab activities are worth 50 points each with
            your lowest score being dropped (Your best 4 scores count for your grade). If you have to miss a lab for any
            reason you will not be able to makeup that activity, but you can drop the 0 and complete the other 4.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Team Project</h4>

        <p>
            During the remaining 3 labs you will demo your team project to the TAs. The first 2 demos are worth 100
            points each with the third worth 200. You will work on this project with your team throughout the semester.
            You will have time to meet with your team after each of the lab quizzes and are expected to spend
            significant time outside of lab to complete the project. To allow time for this no homework will be due on
            the same week as a project demo.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Lecture Questions</h4>

        <p>
            Most lectures will consist of questions or activities that are to be completed before the end of lecture.
            Each lecture is worth 10 points and there will be at least 38 lectures with questions, but your points are
            capped at 300 total. This is meant to reduce the stress of missing a question of having to miss a lecture
            since you can miss 8 lectures and still max out this category. The intent of these questions is to give you
            an opportunity to
            practice the material in the current lecture as you are learning it as opposed to passively attending
            the lecture. To be fully prepared for these questions you should complete the reading for the lecture in
            advance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that these questions are not glorified attendance like you may have experienced in the past.
            A significant portion of lecture will be spent working on these questions. Lectures will roughly follow
            this structure, though each lecture will vary as needed:
        </p>

                <td>5 minutes</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>30 minutes</td>
                <td>Lecture questions. The TAs and myself will answer questions as needed. If there are common questions
                or mass confusion I will present examples demonstrating the topic(s) that are unclear</td>

        <h3 class="card-title">Communication</h3>

        <p>
            There are multiple communication channels available to you through this course. There is no requirement to
            use any of these, though you are encouraged to use any tools that you find helpful. A brief description
            of the recommended and expected use of each is given below, but the use of each will shift based on what
            you utilize and how.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note that these platforms are made available to help you communicate with your classmates as well
            as the course staff. The course
            staff will do what we can to be active on all platforms, but you should not expect us to answer every
            question and respond to every post. With that said, you are much more likely to get a response if you show
            that you are putting in the time to try to understand the material. Posts that just say "help, I'm confused"
            rarely get meaningful responses.

            All of these platforms are used to help you learn the course material with your classmates and the advantage
            of these is that the entire class can see the answers and conversation. Please do not use these to DM
            course staff with specific questions. You will be ignored. If you have a question that requires us to see
            your code please visit us in office hours.

        <p>
            If there is a question that requires my/Jesse's attention (ex. I have to sign paperwork, you have to
            reschedule the final exam, you require accessibility resources) and you can't wait for my office hours
            please send an email to hartloff@buffalo.edu
            with the subject line "CSE116 Instructor" to ensure it gets my proper attention. Any emails/DMs/private
            posts that could be answered by any other means will largely be ignored. I would like to respond to all of
            you, but I simply do not have the time so I must prioritize this way.

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:
            </p>

        <div class="row">

                <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
                    <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE116.</h3>

            <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.

        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming abstract solutions, then writing
                code independently
            </li>
            <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the course topics</li>
            <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Submitting a code or other work that is not your own.</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to see your code or submission for an assignment.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with another student to write code for an assignment [other than working with your
                teammates on the team project].
            </li>
            <li>Allowing another student to access your work that will be submitted for course credit. (Examples: Do not
                post you code publicly, host your code in a public repository, or allow a classmate to access your laptop)
            </li>
            <li>Copying a large amount material found on the Internet into your submission.</li>
            <li>Attempting to access the grading code on AutoLab.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you plan on cheating, plan on taking this course again.
